go.js
=====

**goban.js** is a rewrite of `go.js`.

The latest and last version of `go.js` can be found at commit `7bc33ea18d9c137b12f3521fd93508119ba603c7`.

go.js was split into the following repositories:

1. **goban.js** - core of go.js which is now re-written from scratch

2. **goban.js-raphael** - the 'GUI' of go.js, also re-written from scratch

This is done to reorganize the project to make other projects under the gobanjs umbrella possible.
